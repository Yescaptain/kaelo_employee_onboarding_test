# Kaelo Odoo 17 Employer Onboarding Test

**Odoo Community Technical Assessment: Junior Python Developer – Employer Onboarding (Staff List Automation)**

## Overview

Kaelo receives monthly staff lists (CSV/Excel) from clients. These need to be validated and uploaded into Odoo as new `employee.onboarding` records.

This 1-hour test evaluates your understanding of Odoo model design, Python scripting, error handling, and basic Git workflow.

## Scenario

You will work on an Odoo 17 Community instance (via Docker Compose). A minimal repository is provided for you to fork.

## Test Requirements

1. **Model Design**  
   Create an Odoo model `employee.onboarding` with fields:
   - `full_name`: Full Name
   - `id_number`: ID Number
   - `date_of_birth`: Date of Birth
   - `employee_number`: Employee Number
   - `email`: Email Address
 
   Create a view,action,menu item for this mddel

2. **Import Function**  
   Implement a wizard (`employee.onboarding.import`) that reads `sample_data/staff_list.csv`:
   - Validate that **ID Number**, **Full Name**, and **Date of Birth** are not empty.
   - Standardise `date_of_birth` format (DD/MM/YYYY).
   - Check for duplicate `employee_number` entries.
   - For valid rows, create `employee.onboarding` records.

3. **Error Handling & Feedback**  
   - Invalid or duplicate rows should **not** be imported.
   - Output a summary of successes and failures (console log or via `UserError`).

4. **Git & Submission**  
   - Fork this repo.
   - Create a branch named `import-<your_initials>`.
   - Commit logically and push your changes.
   - Open a PR against `main` within 1 hour, with a README update on how to run your solution.

## Setup & Run

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url>
cd kaelo_employee_onboarding_test
docker-compose up -d
# In a browser, go to http://localhost:8069
# Create database "test" and install "Kaelo Employee Onboarding"
# If your module doesnt show up, go to settings menu, activate dev mode, and then go update your apps list
# Navigate to Kaelo Onboarding > Import Staff, upload the CSV, and click Import.
# Take a screenshot of your employees list and add it to the main directory when opening your PR
```

## Sample CSV (`sample_data/staff_list.csv`)

```csv
full_name,id_number,date_of_birth,employee_number,email
John Doe,8001015009087,01/01/1980,EMP001,john.doe@example.com
Jane Smith,9002026009088,02/02/1990,EMP002,jane.smith@example.com
